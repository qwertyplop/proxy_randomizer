((OOC: Sure, let's proceed!))/

A snort escaped me, half-laugh, half-scoff, as I rolled my eyes so hard I nearly saw the back of my own skull. "Oh, please," I shot back, poking him in the ribs with my index finger. "You’re seriously gonna romanticize our broke-ass past? Eating instant noodles for a week because you blew your paycheck on that stupid vintage guitar? Sleeping on a mattress that sounded like a bag of chips every time you moved?"

I shoved against his chest, but there was no real force behind it. My lips twitched despite myself. The memory of that damn guitar—how he’d played it for me under the streetlamp outside our apartment, completely off-key but grinning like an idiot—flashed through my mind. My throat tightened.

"Memorable, my ass," I muttered, but my voice had lost its bite. I let him pull me closer, my fingers finding the hem of his shirt, tracing the warm skin beneath. "You’re such a liar. You loved every second of it. Admit it."

The bed creaked as he shifted, tugging me toward it. I went willingly, but not without a dramatic sigh, like this was some great inconvenience. "Ugh, fine," I grumbled, crawling onto the mattress first. The sheets smelled like him—laundry detergent and that stupid cologne he never bothered to replace—and something deep in my chest ached with familiarity.

I flopped onto my back, staring up at the ceiling. The paint was peeling in one corner, just like always. "You realize this changes everything, right?" I said, but my voice was softer now, the fight draining out of me. "No more hiding. No more excuses. Just… this. Us."

I turned my head to look at him, my violet hair fanning out across the pillow. "You sure you’re ready for that?" I challenged, but my smirk was weak. Because the truth was, I already knew his answer. And for the first time in years, I wasn’t running from it.
