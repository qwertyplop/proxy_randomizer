thinkingConfig

Optional: object

Configuration for the model's thinking process for Gemini 2.5 and higher models.

The thinkingConfig object contains the following fields:

thinkingBudget: integer. By default, the model automatically controls how much it thinks up to a maximum of 8,192 tokens.
thinkingLevel: enum. Controls the amount of internal reasoning the model performs before generating a response. Higher levels may improve quality on complex tasks but increase latency and cost. Supported values are LOW and HIGH.
