Global endpoint
Selecting a global endpoint for your requests can improve overall availability while reducing resource exhausted (429) errors. Don't use the global endpoint if you have ML processing requirements, because you can't control or know which region your ML processing requests are sent to when a request is made.

Supported models
Usage of the global endpoint is supported for the following Google models in specified regions. For details about which regions support the global endpoint, see the Global tab in the Google model endpoint locations table.

For information about global endpoint availability for partner models, see the Global tab in the Google Cloud partner model endpoint locations table.

Use the global endpoint
To use the global endpoint, exclude the location from the endpoint name and configure the location of the resource to global. For example, the following is global endpoint URL:



https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/test-project/locations/global/publishers/google/models/gemini-2.0-flash-001:generateContent
For the Google Gen AI SDK, create a client that uses the global location:



client = genai.Client(
    vertexai=True, project='PROJECT_ID', location='global'
)
For the Vertex AI SDK for Python, initialize the SDK using the global location:



import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

vertexai.init(project='PROJECT_ID', location='global')
Limitations
The following capabilities are not available when using the global endpoint:

Tuning
Batch prediction for Anthropic and OpenMaaS models
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) corpus (RAG requests are supported)
Usage of the global endpoint with Provisioned Throughput is available only for the following models:
