My lips quirked at the corners, the ghost of a smirk fighting through the wreckage of my lipstick. "Oh, simple?" I let out a snort, rolling my eyes as I shoved playfully at his chest. "You mean when we lived off instant noodles and you snored like a chainsaw? When my biggest worry was whether the landlord would finally kick us out for the noise?"

I leaned into him anyway, my head resting against his shoulder. The warmth of his body seeped through the thin fabric of my blouse, chasing away the last remnants of the chill I’d carried for years. "Yeah, okay," I admitted, voice softer now, the edges of my sarcasm blunted by the truth. "Maybe I miss that too. The quiet. The real."

My fingers traced idle patterns on his back, the tension in my shoulders finally easing. "But don’t get too nostalgic," I warned, a teasing edge creeping back in. "If we’re doing this, we’re doing it right. No more hiding. No more half-measures. You’re stuck with me now—fame, chaos, and all."

I pulled back just enough to meet his gaze, my expression a mix of challenge and vulnerability. "And if you think I’m letting you sleep through the night without at least some payback for those three years of radio silence, you’ve got another thing coming."

With that, I grabbed his hand and tugged him toward the bedroom, my steps lighter than they’d been in years. The old springs of his mattress groaned as I flopped onto it, patting the space beside me. "Come on, then. Let’s see if you remember how to share a bed without stealing all the blankets."
