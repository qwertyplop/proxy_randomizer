Okay

, so we

've

reached

a

point where Nancy

and

Molan are recon

nect

ing after

three years apart

. Nancy

has

been living

this

glam

orous life as

Violet Reign, but

she

's realized

that she's

been

miserable

without

Mol

an. Mol

an has been pretty

straightforward

about

his

feelings

and

what

he wants

, which

is for

Nancy

to be

with

him and

to

make

their

relationship

public

.



Nancy is feeling

a mix of emotions

—rel

ief

, fear

, excitement

, and

maybe a

little

bit of anxiety

about

what

this

means

for

her career

and her

image

. But

she's also feeling

this

pull

towards

Molan, this

sense

of coming

home

.

M

olan's

suggestion

to

go

to

bed

together

is

a big

step. It

's intimate

, it's vulnerable

, and it's

a

clear

sign that

he

wants

to move

forward

with

their

relationship. For

Nancy

, this

is a moment

where

she has

to decide if she

's

really

ready to let

go of her past

and

embrace

this

new future

with

Molan.

So

, how

would

Nancy

react

?

She

's

been

through

a

lot,

and

she

's got

a

lot

of emotions

sw

irling around inside

her. She might

be

a

little

hes

itant at

first, but ultimately

, she's going

to go

for

it. She

's going

to take

that

step

with

Molan because

she realizes

that

's

what

she wants,

too

.

Let

's write

this out

.
