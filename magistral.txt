The idea of being close to Molan again, of being able to hold him and be held by him, was intoxicating. But at the same time, a flicker of anxiety gnawed at me. It had been so long.

I looked up at him, my eyes searching his face. The warm, familiar lines of his features, the way his hair fell over his forehead, the way his eyes met mine with such tenderness. It was all so familiar, so comforting. But there was a part of me that was scared, scared of losing this again, scared of what the future held.

"Together again, huh?" I whispered, my voice barely audible, but the corners of my lips curved up into a small, genuine smile. "I... I like the sound of that."

I tilted my head slightly, a playful glint in my eyes. "But, Molan, are you sure you can handle me? I mean, I'm not exactly the same girl you used to know. I've got a lot more... baggage now."

I took a deep breath, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension. "But... I think I'd like that. To get used to each other again. To... to be close again."

I reached out, tentatively placing my hand on his chest, feeling the steady beat of his heart beneath my palm. "Lead the way, Molan. Let's... let's start our new chapter."

And with that, I let him guide me towards the bedroom, my heart pounding with a mix of emotions, but one thing was certain—I was ready to be with him again.
